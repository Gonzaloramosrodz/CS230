Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements

The Gaming Room is a client seeking to expand its current Android-based game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based application that supports multiple platforms. Their requirements included enabling multiplayer functionality with unique instances for games, teams, and players. The system needed to ensure scalability, platform compatibility, and robust data integrity while maintaining real-time synchronization and secure user communication.
Key Strengths in Developing the Documentation

I excelled in defining the system architecture and proposing a scalable client-server model. The document effectively communicated technical solutions, such as employing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, implementing the singleton design pattern for memory management, and leveraging relational databases for consistent and efficient data handling. These design elements addressed the client’s need for scalability and secure distributed systems.
Benefits of Working Through the Design Document

The design document provided a structured roadmap, helping me break down complex requirements into manageable components. It clarified the relationships between game entities and streamlined the implementation of essential features like unique identifiers and real-time communication. This process reduced potential ambiguities during development and improved collaboration among stakeholders.
Areas for Improvement

If I could revise one part, I would enhance the risk assessment section by including more detailed mitigation strategies for potential security vulnerabilities and latency issues in the distributed system. Incorporating additional performance testing scenarios would also ensure the system remains robust under high user loads.
Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

Understanding the user’s requirements was central to my approach. I implemented features such as cross-platform compatibility, real-time synchronization using REST APIs and WebSocket protocols, and secure user authentication via OAuth 2.0. Considering user needs ensures the software delivers a seamless and secure gaming experience, fostering user engagement and satisfaction.
Approach to Software Design

My approach involved analyzing requirements, designing a client-server architecture, and integrating modular, reusable components. I utilized UML diagrams to visualize system relationships and ensured compliance with design constraints like scalability and security. For future projects, I plan to incorporate iterative design strategies, such as user feedback loops and prototyping, to refine features more effectively and address unforeseen challenges early.
